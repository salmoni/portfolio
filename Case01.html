                This project had three broad strands of content. The client reported being unhappy with the general
                UI design, specifically the layout and navigability and usability. There was also
                a desire to increase the cross-sell of other products.
            </p>
            <p>
                One strand of information had already been updated but it was felt this could be bettered.
            </p>
            <p>
                My job was to take one of these strands (industry
                information) and make it better than it was before.

                content hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created a full content inventory of the industry information using several maps
                that reflected different approaches to the data. This showed how
                all the different components related to each other and how they were grouped in
                ways that were meaningful to users and editors.

            <br />
            <p>
                I examined analytics for user behaviours / user journeys: How did users get around?
                How did they navigate? When did they go down a rabbit warren only to turn back?
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed stakeholders to understand the business needs (particularly page-level
                information): This gave me insight into how the organisation work, what challenges
                they faced, what they wanted from a redesign and the many constraints necessary for
                a new design to take into account including desired marketing messages. Included was
                information the landing pages should have (a formal ranking exercise). We found a
                difference between editorial and marketing staff which required mediation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Outcomes:
                </strong>
                User and stakeholder research combined to inform the function of the site. One key
                purpose was to increase cross-sell and make the interface more navigable. The
                former was designed to be "baked in": When users accessed an article outside of
                their subscription, they were given a brief summary of the article along with a
                call-to-action to purchase the relevant subscription. The latter
                was provided by focusing the design more upon salient aspects and using gradual
                disclosure to allow users to explore though both agreed that content needed
                to be more interactive for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another need was to inform users that they were working on a particular article
                (the publishing cycle was fairly slow at about 1-2 per month) and a suggestion
                to use and embed social media onto the site was made and accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final requirement was for effective visualisations of data to illustrate
                articles and to make the site less text-heavy.

                I created a new draft sitemap/information architecture which iterated as work progressed.
                I began making a real thing of creation here by sketching out how information could be
                structured, and tested how users would get from one point to another followed by how this

                The final draft of the sitemap was intended for developers and

                of the navigation system (desktop and mobile) communicated how users would navigate
                from point to point.

            <p>
                The final artefact from this phase was that I could calculate the number of

                A significant part of the research was understanding business needs in terms of
                how they function, what barriers and pain-points they encounter, and what
                their business goals are.
            </p>
            <p>
                By this time, I knew what information needed to be communicated to users (at
                last from the various stakeholders' perspectives) but not the priority.
            </p>
            <p>
                What was needed was a sense of priority so I organised a workshop with stakeholders
                that forced them to prioritise information through an interactive design exercise. I
                was careful to set expectations that the design was not final but that what would be built
                would be a combination of all their efforts along with user needs and the legal and
                technical constraints

                    Outcomes:
                </strong>
                We got a series of captured designs that, while probably individually unworkable,
                provided significant insight into what pieces of information had which priority.
                By this time, we had refined a lot into specific details from the high-level view.

                support for the designs, they were documented in a more formal way.

                Wireframes were sketched for free ideation and rapid feedback from stakeholders. Doing
                this allowed me to create many sketches for templates in a short space of time and
                finalise the design.

                The designs received some usability testing but less than an ideal amount but
                was necessary given project funding restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The testing showed that users handled the new version better than the existing version
                with fewer misunderstandings about subscriptions and product visibility, more
                accurate navigation, and better focus.

            <p>
                I began to create annotated wireframes to pass the design to the development team.
                This included some clickable prototypes in HTML/CSS and JQuery (JavaScript) to illustrate
                how different widgets were meant to work.
