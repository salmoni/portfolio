                A global information consultancy (B2B) had multiple products providing bespoke news
                and expert analysis to industry. They had two questions:
            </p>
            <p>
                Should products be merged? Either way, how to increase cross-sell and up-sell?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a last-ditch attempt after several false starts. I was also the only UX specialist.

            <p>
                This project required absolute precision. It was a major investment for the client and the business
                needs had to be clear, agreed and actionable for me to do productive work and make this project a
                success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The business needs had to drive the business case (and, by definition, my work) so time was well
                spent clarifying them with senior stakeholders. With this knowledge, I created a workable plan to
                answer both key questions and provide strategic direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was clear that there were, rather, three key questions:
            <ul class="list ms-4">
                <li>
                    Who is the audience?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What needs to be changed?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What should change look like?
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <strong>
                    Outcomes:
                </strong>
                As a professional who regularly turns visions into reality,
                I was comfortable with providing the right direction to the company but
                I still needed specialist knowledge of the business from the senior stakeholders.
                With careful negotiation, I was able to clarify their needs and then offer the client a
                positive path forward that mitigated risks and evidenced a solid business case.

                I examined almost 60 competitors against my client's products to

                senior stakeholders, and these criteria gave me further background to feed into user research.

                I began with a series of interviews of existing customers. The aim was understanding how they used this
                company's information (goals, barriers, etc) and topics were guided by existing desk research (from the
                content inventory, analytics, competitor analysis and stakeholder work).
            </p>
            <p>
                Output was analysed for themes and, in turn, guided
                a survey issued to all existing customers. There was a specific strategic decision not to
                approach non-customers.

                <strong>

                The interviews identified themes among customers and the survey put some
                strength and numbers on those themes. From this work, it was clear that there was an overwhelming
                appetite among customers to merge all products. The first question was answered and I also discovered
                that customers had little in common (low evidence of homogeneity). Their needs, goals, behaviours and
                barriers differed too drastically for consistency.

                A card sort was organised using Optimal Workshop because customers were unable to attend locally.
                Separate card sorts were also issued across the company to both evangelise the activity and
                to compare and highlight company internal experience versus customer experience.

                A new sitemap was crafted (below) using the card sort analysis data. This included
                navigation systems for desktop and mobile devices but because of resource constraints,
                we were unable to do tree testing. The client felt confident the IA was workable because the
                research work until now had been of a very high quality and reliable.

            <p>
                Increased functionality derived from user research was added. Because of the lack of
                consistency among users, capabilities for personalisation and customisation were also added.

                    Of key value to users (and therefore the client) was the design of the template for
                    individual articles. This was "terminal-node" (i.e., ultimate information goal)
                    information that represented the most value to customers so
                    extra work was required to ensure they met requirements.

                    I worked with a graphic designer who created five different candidate page designs.
                    After I discussed the user needs and justifications for design decisions, she created
                    these for consideration using the constraints from user research that I'd provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question remained of how all these different products should hang together in a
                    way that made sense to users.

                    I had the basic design of the key page for all users. I now needed to make real the
                    specifics of how people interacted with the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My challenge now was using every
                    bit of information I had about the business, the client, the subject and the users
                    and to bring it all together into a coherent, sensible and useful whole.

                    After intense creative thinking, the solution came. The one feature all users relied upon was
                    location. All their actions were guided by where things were happening. Sure, other features played
                    a role, but location was the primary feature.

                    that made sense to users.

                But this was hard to communicate to product-minded stakeholders and them being able
                to play with such a system would go further than just being shown.

            <p>I created a clickable prototype using HTML/CSS/JS (using the Bootstrap framework) with some

                Research showed consensus among users about using geography as navigation but the form differed.
                Some used maps, others used text, others bookmarks. The navigation system had to incorporate
                all these methods so functions allowed both text-based, map-based and user-defined locations to be
                located and specified. These are shown below.
