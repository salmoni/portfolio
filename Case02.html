                An investor in New Zealand had a new venture after he and his friend had spotted a market gap for a
                shooting range in Phuket. The difference was that this was to be a thoroughly professional affair with
                qualified ex-military instructors, close links with professional associations and formal training
                courses: Training and experiences that were fun and effective but also safe and of high quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having just opened, the face-to-face business operations were being smoothed out but there was no
                digital presence and they wanted one.

                The initial negotiations with the investors were about ways of working, budget, deadlines and
                requirements. I was able to reassure them that the first phase of work (getting a basic site up and
                running within a few days) would be completed and that further work would continue along with
                identifying areas of growth and continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                First was understanding the business (market, operations, likely growth opportunities and
                barriers) and then create a digital experience that complemented the bricks and mortar business. It
                would be transferred to their control at the right point in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                From desk research (tourist data and competitors), we estimated that users would likely be
                tourists, probably already in Thailand, but we also
                wanted to appeal globally for when people planned their holidays. Our strategy was to get the site
                running in a few days and employ analytics to guide further growth. Competitor analysis
                with the investors was done to identify desired and useful features and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key business goals were awareness among customers and "pull factors" to challenge
                competition. This meant high search ranking, accessibility and wide appeal to tourists. One investor had
                an appetite to having online bookings and payments but this was not feasible in the short term because
                it required the business to radically change and was scheduled to be a future change.

                A baptism of fire with an immediate deep dive into how real-world Thai business works. Aspects like
                commission-based recommendations were a surprise but also added colour to understanding what an online
                showcase could bring.

                Wireframes and user journeys (initially hand-drawn but soon after in Figma) were shared with the
                investors to finalise initial
                ideas. I began searching for a technical solution. This had to get a web presence up fast and could be
                handled by non-technical staff: I wasn't going to be around forever so this was important.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided
                upon Wix as reasonably priced and with a low barrier to entry as well as being amenable to operation by
                staff on the range. There was debate about online bookings
                but doing so meant the entire business had to go digital, including front-office. The company was not
                ready yet so booking requests were a compromise.

                With the basic structure, I began planning content for each page with an eye for search engine
                optimisation. Main content would be in English, Thai, Arabic, Chinese and Russian. Using tourist
                data
                and similar businesses as estimators, we predicted that many customers would be speaking these
                languages and meeting them halfway could give the business an edge over competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Content included page titles, meta information, alt-text, headings, text, images and videos and was
                initially created in English. I also researched for SEO-positive keywords and ensured they were
                present.
                Once written, content was automatically translated into the other four languages for speed. Proper
                translations would follow later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Language selection which had to be quick and mobile-friendly and be incorporated into navigation.

            <p>
                I anticipated that mobile phones would be the most common channel and began a mobile-first design.
                This
                isn't easy in Wix - it aims for desktop first then adjust for mobile, but the design itself was made
                with mobile in mind. This was to be an important decision when we first got analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
                A carousel of images was planned for the front page (circulated regularly for SEO purposes) along
                with
                introductory text. The images would show either groups of happy people with targets or people being
                coached to communicate positivity and fun but also seriousness and safety in the right context. We
                also
                showed pictures of a female instructor (rare) with a female customer (common), something that gave
                the
                business a competitive edge with some market segments. The text was refined with the help of some large
                language models until the investors were satisfied that the business goals would be reached.
            </p>
            <p>
                The staff page was crucial to show the experience and qualifications of instructors as was the list
                of
                range rules. A basic booking request facility was implemented with an associated email address and
                tested with sensible and anomalous data for failure until it worked. The courses page was based on a
                graphic tarpaulin but improved with information laid out.

                One critical page was instructions on how to get there. The maps that came with Wix had very poor
                contrast and were not suitable for people with visual accessibility needs. I found an alternative by
                embedding Google Maps directly which was much more satisfactory.

                The website's aim was to attract customers via digital channels on a global basis
                beginning with provincial-level awareness. Google's Search Console and GA4 analytics were used along
                with the Bing and Yandex Webmaster Tools. Bing feeds into many other search engines like DuckDuckGo
                and
                Yahoo! and Yandex was aimed at appealing to Russian customers. Baidu required Chinese nationality
                which
                we did not have and we are still considering Naver for Korean customers. Google covers just about
                everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made recommendations to increase backlinks from reputable social media channels. A Facebook page
                had
                been running but wasn't linked and new social media channels were made to increase visibility. Two
                are
                actively populated and I've recommended their content is mirrored on other channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility was bolstered by adding meta tags across the entire site, a big task, and a basic
                level of testing done. Proper in-person testing was not possible due to resource constraints.

                After a week or so, GA4 outputs showed that indeed, the vast majority of visitors browsed on mobile.
                Languages were more diverse than locations (vastly Thailand).

            <p>
                Customers came mostly directly but this has morphed over time and organic searches are now more
                common. Examination of common search terms showed that the site has risen from nowhere to appearing
                highly in Bing and Yandex for province-level searches.

                On Yandex for a national-level search, we are number one for some Russian language province-level
                searches. Curiously, the Thai and Arabic versions don't rank at all there which is probably an
                oddity of Yandex itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bing strategy is working well with top 5 rankings for English province-level searches but a
                reduced ranking for national-level searches and no ranking for non-English results. I'm trying to
                puzzle that one out but it's not an indexing issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google is still hit-or-miss but that's probably down to backlink strategy which I need to work
                harder on. My suggestions are to get social media running well, encourage customers to write reviews
                and get the site featured in local tourist sites. All search engines report no backlinks which is
                again odd because they exist and two listed on Google.

                From not existing, the website ranked highly for common queries and was often already ahead of local

                Work remained, however, to improve ranking on Google. The newness of the site compared to
                competitors
                was a factor we could not control other than releasing the site as soon as possible (which we did
                with
                just this in mind). We could, however, improve our backlinking and formally tying up with
                high-quality
                social media channels to increase site authority. A number of content changes (particularly meta
                information and alt-text) were adjusted to improve accessibility and, by consequence, search
                authority.

                Visitors had a diverse range of languages with Thai being a small minority; but they were also
                located in Thailand. This indicated that most were tourists searching for a shooting range rather
                than searching at home before they arrive. This may be just how things are but it might also be our
                relative lack of visibility around the world. One initiative would be to increase global visibility
                and test if audiences contact the business when nearby or not.

                We've also expanded the content to update it more frequently and will be testing social media feeds
