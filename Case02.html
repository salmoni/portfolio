                An investor in New Zealand had a new venture after he and his friend had spotted a market gap for a
                shooting range in Phuket. The difference was that this was to be a thoroughly professional affair with
                qualified ex-military instructors, close links with professional associations and formal training
                courses:
                Training and experiences that were fun and effective but also safe and of high quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having just opened, the face-to-face business operations were being smoothed out but there was no
                digital
                presence and they wanted one.
            </p>
            <p>

            <br />
            <p>
                First, I had to understand the business (its market, operations, likely growth opportunities and
                barriers) and create a digital experience that complemented the bricks and mortar business. It would be
                eventually transferred to their control once I'd set everything up.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the market, we had some idea it would be tourists, probably already in Thailand, but we also wanted
                to appeal globally for when people planned their holidays. Our strategy was to get the site up and
                running in a few days and use analytics to guide further work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key business goals were awareness among customers and "pull factors" to place them in line or above
                competition. This meant high search ranking, accessibility and wide appeal to tourists. One investor had
                an appetite to having online bookings and payments but this was not feasible in the short term because
                it required the business to radically change. Instead, this was a phase 3 change.
            </p>

                <strong>
                    Outcomes:
                </strong>
                This was a baptism of fire with an immediate deep dive into how a Thai business works in the real world.
                Aspects like commission-based recommendations were a surprise but also added colour to understanding
                what an online showcase could bring.

                Hand-drawn sketches of wireframes and user journeys were shared with the investors to finalise initial
                ideas. I began searching for a technical solution. This had to get a web presence up fast and could be
                handled by non-technical staff: I wasn't going to be around forever so this was important. We decided
                upon Wix as reasonably priced and with a low barrier to entry. There was debate about online bookings
                but doing so meant the entire business had to go digital, including front-office. The company was not
                ready yet so booking requests were a compromise.

                With the basic structure, I began planning content for each page with an eye for search engine
                optimisation. The site would be in English, Thai, Arabic, Chinese and Russian as many customers were
                estimated to use these languages so translations were needed. Automated ones were used initially.
                Content included page titles, meta information, headings, text, images and videos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigation included language selection, social media channels (one was already working) along with
                specified links in the main body of content.

            <br />
            <p>
                I anticipated that mobile phones would be the most common channel and began a mobile-first design. This
                isn't easy in Wix - it aims for desktop first then adjust for mobile, but the design itself was made
                with mobile in mind. This was to be an important decision when we first got analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
                A carousel of images was planned for the front page (circulated regularly for SEO purposes) along with
                introductory text. The images would show either groups of happy people with targets or people being
                coached to communicate positivity and fun but also seriousness ans safety in the right context. We also
                showed pictures of a female instructor (rare) with a female customer (common), something that gave the
                business a competitive edge with some market segments. The text was refined so that the investors were
                satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>
                The staff page was crucial to show the experience and qualifications of instructors as was the list of
                range rules. A basic booking request facility was implemented with an associated email address and
                tested with sensible and anomalous data for failure until it worked. The courses page was based on a
                graphic tarpaulin but improved with information laid out.
            </p>
            <p>
                One critical page was instructions on how to get there. The maps that came with Wix had very poor
                contrast and were not suitable for people with visual accessibility needs. I found an alternative by
                embedding Google Maps directly which was much more satisfactory.

                Next was the SEO strategy. The aim was to attract customers via digital channels on a global basis
                beginning with provincial-level awareness. Google's Search Console and GA4 analytics were used along
                with the Bing and Yandex Webmaster Tools. Bing feeds into many other search engines like DuckDuckGo and
                Yahoo! and Yandex was aimed at appealing to Russian customers. Baidu required Chinese nationality which
                we did not have and we are still considering Naver for Korean customers. Google covers just about
                everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made recommendations to increase backlinks from reputable social media channels. A Facebook page had
                been running but wasn't linked and new social media channels were made to increase visibility. Two are
                actively populated and I've recommended their content is mirrored on other channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility was bolstered by adding meta tags across the entire site, a big task, and a basic
                level of testing done. Proper in-person testing was not possible due to resource constraints.

                    After a week or so, GA4 outputs showed that indeed, most visitors were on mobile and around 95% of
                    visitors come via mobile. Languages were more diverse than locations (vastly Thailand).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers came mostly directly but this has morphed over time and organic searches are now more
                    common. Examination of common search terms showed that the site has risen from nowhere to appearing
                    highly in Bing and Yandex for province-level searches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Yandex for a national-level search, we are number one for some Russian language province-level
                    searches. Curiously, the Thai and Arabic versions don't rank at all there which is probably an
                    oddity of Yandex itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bing strategy is working well with top 5 rankings for English province-level searches but a
                    reduced ranking for national-level searches and no ranking for non-English results. I'm trying to
                    puzzle that one out but it's not an indexing issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google is still hit-or-miss but that's probably down to backlink strategy which I need to work
                    harder on. My suggestions are to get social media running well, encourage customers to write reviews
                    and get the site featured in local tourist sites. All search engines report no backlinks which is
                    again odd because they exist and two listed on Google.

                    Visitors had a diverse range of languages with Thai being a small minority; but they were also
                    located in Thailand. This indicated that most were tourists searching for a shooting range rather
                    than searching at home before they arrive. This may be just how things are but it might also be our
                    relative lack of visibility around the world. One initiative would be to increase global visibility
                    and test if audiences contact the business when nearby or not.

                    We've also expanded the content to update it more frequently and will be testing social media feeds
                    soon. This should provide users with affirmation that the business is active and thriving as well as
                    improving search engine ranking.

                    A recent bout of improvements to meta data should be improving search rankings and accessibility
                    along with clarifying content to users and making some pages easier to scan by search engines.
